They share a common connection as biological concepts.  Explanation for Category2: - BOTTLE, CRIB, MOBILE, and RATTLE are all types of objects that can be found in a nursery or a baby's room.

However, one possible connection is that DOG is a living creature, FREEZE is a verb, PHONE is a device, and PRICE is a numerical value. But a more specific connection is that DOG and PHONE are both objects that can be associated with a person's personal life, FREEZE is a verb that can be used in the context of a phone's freeze feature, and PRICE is a numerical value that can be associated with the price of a phone. However, this connection is a bit of a stretch and not as clear as the other categories.   Considering the categories, the connection between Category1 and Category3 is not clear. However, if we look at Category2, we can see a possible connection between Category2 and Category4. Category2 contains items that can be found in a nursery or a baby's room, while Category4 contains items that are not directly related to each other but can be associated with a person's personal life.   A possible revised Category4 could be: Category4: [DOG, FREEZE, PHONE, PRICE]  Explanation for revised Category4: - DOG is a living creature, FREEZE is a verb that can be used in the context of a phone's freeze feature, PHONE is a device, and PRICE is a numerical value that can be associated with the price of a phone.
