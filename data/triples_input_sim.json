CREATE has no color and I think this like and no color trio basically does no more like like verb however some phrases like has prefix un might fit the bill. 8. CREATE has suffix Ly I think I found some like and has pairs that look like like like verb. However they might simply have just like or has suffix and thus can't really use the concept. 9.
