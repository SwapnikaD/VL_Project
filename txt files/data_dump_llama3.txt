Exposure and exposure time are related concepts as exposure time is a broad concept that can encompass various types of exposure while exposure can be a shortened version of exposure time in photography contexts. \n2. Exposure and concealment are opposite as exposure involves making something known or apparent and concealment involves keeping something unknown or hidden.\n3. Exposure is a type of risk as exposure often carries uncertainty about outcomes or potential dangers.\n4. Exposure is related to environmental science as it can have various impacts on the environment, human health, or animals in ecosystems sometimes these are unavoidable.\n5. Exposure typically has negative connotations in sentences and statements by itself but the context defines the usage of exposure. In photography or environmental contexts, especially.\n6. The indication of exposure might show vulnerability as being exposed in an instance means you are likely to be judged negatively, experience pain or be affected more by things. Therefore, exposure to a virus, or the emotional fallout may illustrate vulnerability better. It often makes people feel unprotected since the lack of protection creates that vulnerable condition that usually you show facing more negative experiences when exposed to an instance.\n7. Exposure is a term used in various types of photography and the exposure in photography contains all parameters of capturing a final image.\n8. Exposure has the suffix -able as it is a state that can be transferred or reacted on. For example if a new discovery made changes exposure to the public which often give more acceptability to new evidence given or more easily changes peoples perception and behavior following the said exposure.\n9. Ex- is a prefix of exposure in phrasing related to exposure or meaning  being taken out, leaving, or removed (such as ex-communicated) or removed from.\n10.
