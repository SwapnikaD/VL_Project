Category2: BRIGHT, FLASHY, GARISH, PLATINUMThis category appears to contain words that are related to light, color, or brilliance. \"Bright\" and \"Flashy\" refer to something that is shining or glowing, \"Garish\" means overly bright or showy, and \"Platinum\" is a bright, shiny metal.  Category3: DIRTY, STINKER, HUG, OFThis category is more abstract, but all of these words can be related to personal hygiene or cleanliness. \"Dirty\" is the opposite of clean, \"Stinker\" is something that smells bad, \"Hug\" can refer to a physical gesture that is meant to be intimate or close, and \"Of\" is often used in phrases related to personal hygiene (e.g., \"Of the shower\").

The goal is to identify the combination of 16 words that can be grouped into four categories.  Categories:  \"RELIGIOUS TITLES: BROTHER, BISHOP, CARDINAL, PRIOR\" I chose these four words because they are all titles associated with Christianity. A brother can refer to a lay brother or a member of a Christian order, a bishop is a high-ranking clergy, a cardinal is a senior bishop in the Catholic Church, and a prior is the head of a monastery.  \"ROYALTY: LORD, MADONNA, PRINCE, QUEEN\" I selected these four words because they are all terms related to royalty or nobility. A lord is a title of nobility, Madonna is a European royal family, Prince is a title of nobility, and Queen is a title of the wife of a king.  \"RELIGIOUS OFFICIANTS: PASTOR, PRIOR, LORD, SHEESH\" I chose these four words because they are all related to religious or priestly duties. A pastor is a religious leader, a prior is the head of a monastery, Lord is a title of God, and Sheesh is a phrase used to express astonishment or surprise, which may be related to prayer or preaching.  \"CHURCH MUSIC: HEART, SOUL, ROAM, DELI\" I selected these four words because they are all related to music inspired by Christianity. The heart and soul are metaphors often used in music and poetry, to roam implies to wander or travel, which may be related to the journey of faith, and a deli can be a type of a music venue or a reference to the last supper."

The goal is to find the correct categories without repeating any previous guesses, using each of the 16 words only once.  Here are my guesses for the four categories:  \"Category1: HERO, SCOTT, BLADE, DRIVER\" These words all relate to profession or role. HERO can be a title or a figurative description, while SCOTT is a common first name. BLADE refers to a type of tool or object commonly associated with occupations like surgery or construction. DRIVER is a job or role that many people have.  \"Category2: HOAGIE, GRINDER, SUB, MATCH\" These words all relate to food or eating. HOAGIE and SUB are types of sandwiches, while GRINDER is a slang term for a kind of sandwich. MATCH can refer to a food item or an act of pairing.  \"Category3: HINGE, MATCH, TINDER, BUMBLE\" These words all relate to fire or combustion. HINGE can refer to a type of joint in a fire door, while MATCH and TINDER both have obvious connections to fire starting. BUMBLE can be a reference to a type of insect often associated with bees and fire.  \"Category4: NEAR DARK, TWILIGHT, LOST BOYS, WEST\" These words all relate to place or direction. NEAR DARK and TWILIGHT refer to time of day or atmospheric conditions. LOST BOYS is a reference to a group of boys who got lost in a place, while WEST is a direction on a compass."
